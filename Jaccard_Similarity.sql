Use case:
How can I write a query that can select all orders that are at least % similar to a specific order?  (Order #4 and 75% used in this example)

Approach:
Jaccard index, also known as Intersection over Union:
- The two orders (specified order & potential matching order) must have at least one item in common
- The number of items in an order that it has in common with the specified order. 
- The number of items in each order.

To meet an 85% Jaccard Similarity criterion, if the number of items in either order is less than some threshold, the orders must be identical. 
For example, if both orders A and B have 5 items, say, but there's one item different between the two, 
it gives you 4 items in common (|A∩B|) and 6 items in total (|A∪B|), so the Jaccard Similarity J(A,B) is only 66.666%.
